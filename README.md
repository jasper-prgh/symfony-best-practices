# SOLID principles

S: 'Single Responsibility' -> Do one thing only!

O/C: 'Open/Closed' -> Open for extension, closed for modifying

L: Liskov (F) Principle -> Subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes

I: Interface Segregation -> A class should not implement an interface it does not need

D: Dependency Inversion -> A class should not depend on implementation, but abstraction
